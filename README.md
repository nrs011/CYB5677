I proposed an iris recognition method focused on deep learning and convolutional neural networks in this paper (CNN). Despite the fact that CNN is used for machine learning, the recognition is accomplished by constructing a non-trained CNN network with multiple layers. The code's main goal is to accurately recognize the test pictures' category (aka individual name) after extracting enough features from training pictures of the same category from a dataset that I applied to the code. I used the IITD iris dataset, which consisted of 10 iris images for 223 individuals.
